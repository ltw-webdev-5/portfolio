    <h2 class="coral push-0">Background</h2>
    <p class="milli">A local massage therapy clinic called Kneaded Touch, was the chosen company for this logo redesign project. Their ongoing goal is to provide massage therapy services that make clients feel relieved from their chronic pain.</p>
    <p class="milli">The appearance of their current logo is far too generic for its competitive market. Based on the findings, the logo incorporates 2 serif fonts, 3 colours (green, blue and orange), gradients and a
graphic of a sprout. Green and blue are recurring colours in competing logos and while the hint of orange is more unique, it is not strongly utilized. The symbol of a plant is also generally used in spa brand identities which may be misleading to viewers. Overall, Kneaded Touch needs a unique logo design that stands strong amongst its competitors.</p>
