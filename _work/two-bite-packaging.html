    <h2 class="coral push-0">Challenge</h2>
    <p class="milli">Transform plastic product packaging into an eco-friendly design. The challenge was to replace all or reduce as much plastic as possible. In addition, a theme and a second element needed to be included in this design project.</p>

    <h2 class="coral push-0">Background</h2>
    <p class="milli">Two-Bite is a company known for its unique, bite sized baked goodies sold in grocery stores. They are mostly famous for their delicious brownies and cupcakes. Their assorted mini goods were made to bring people together. Whether it be with family, friends or co-workers, these treats are enjoyed best with other people.</p>
    <p class="milli">Two-biteâ€™s red velvet cupcakes are the main focus of this packaging project. The problem with their original packaging is that it is entirely made of plastic. It would be amazing if the plastic usage could at least be reduced and replaced with eco-materials. This was a great challenge since a dieline needed to be designed for a package of twelve mini cupcakes instead of a single object.</p>

    <p class="milli">The final execution of this cupcake package redesign, resulted in replacing the majority of plastic material with biodegradable materials. Cardstock paper was used for the main structure of the box. Unfortunately the box could not be entirely free of plastic but a better alternative was using already recycled plastic material.</p>
    <p class="milli">A window made of recycled plastic material, serves as a vital feature because consumers need to be able to view the contents inside. It is important for consumers to be able to observe the state of the cupcakes before purchasing them because it provides assurance that they are truly buying what is advertised.</p>
    <p class="milli">The simple box shape makes it easy to stack on top of other boxes, shelves and tables in stores. The rigid edges and alternating shades of red along the sides of the lid, represent the folds of the paper cup that holds the cupcakes. Its interior structure holds all twelve cupcakes in a fun staircase display. The display leaves enough finger space to grab one cupcake without touching the others, making it sanitary conscious as well.</p>
    <p class="milli">Aside from the structure, the colour palette consisting of red, burgundy, black and white were reused from the original packaging because they complement the specific flavour of the product. All written information, as well as the logo was included from the original packaging.</p>
    <p class="milli">Gifting is the theme of this design. So for the second element, a custom cupcake tag was attached to the box with a hemp cord. A sweet message or the name of the person receiving this gift can be written on the tag. Overall, this was a successful eco-friendly packaging design that further stands out against its competitors.</p>
