They offer a variety of services like lash extensions, eyebrow microblading and more. In August, 2019, the founder of Luxury Lash & Browtique was preparing to start running lash extension training classes.

    <p class="milli">Each diagram incorporates the brand colours and font, making them appear as a cohesive set of graphics. The application of the brand colours along with the layouts make it easy to highlight and identify the importances in every composition. The client was very satisfied with these results and was happy to include them in their manual to share with new lash tech learners.</p>
