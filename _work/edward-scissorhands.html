    <h2 class="coral push-0">Background</h2>
    <p class="milli">Edward Scissorhands is the main character of a popular live action Tim Burton film in the 90s. It is a bittersweet story about a kind, man-made character who was left unfinished due to his inventor’s passing. He was introduced to a neighbourhood where many humans lived. People were afraid of his sharp hands and gothic appearance at first. One of Edwards first impressions made him well known for cutting hedges and bushes into impressive masterpieces.</p>

      <p class="milli">This symbol design clearly represents Edward Scissorhands’ characteristics. At first glance, his facial expression is the first thing that is noticed and it displays the emotional side of his story. Next, the arms extend outside of the surrounding vine, showing motion as he is cutting through the stems and leaves. This symbol focuses on his creative ability of using his scissor hands. In this case, it is emphasized that he was a great landscape artist. The colour palette includes a bright green and dark, navy blue. The high contrast between the colours reflect on the brightness as well as the darkness portrayed in the story. There are also curves and sharp edges in this graphic that highlight the iconic Tim Burton art style. The final execution is a strong symbol that contains its structure from large scale to small scale and stays just as strong in simple black and white.</p>
