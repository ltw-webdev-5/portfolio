        <p class="">This project was a practice in booklet layout. This particular one was a mockup of plays for a play bill. The requirements were to only have one play per page and to give each section a title page. We were not allowed to include images.</p>

            <p class="push-1-4">As with any type layout I started with sketches before placing any text into InDesign. I decided to go with a simple and clean layout. I wanted the layout to be easy to navigate for readers. The main goal of a playbill is to provide the information about the play readers need to know so they can attend the plays. I wanted each piece of information to stand out so when a reader is looking for a particular piece it is easy and quick to find.</p>

            <img itemprop="image" class="img-flex" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/playbill/pages-2.jpg" alt="">
          </div>
          <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1 push">
            <p class="push-1-4">Once the layout was decided I had to decide on a hierarchy. As with the layout I wanted information to stand out to viewer but I also wanted it to look like one cohesive section. Location and date was palced together for quick veiwing and play descriptions were given space to create sections within each page.</p>

          <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1 push">
            <p class="push-1-4">Overall the layout came out very clean and simple and easy to navigate. It gave enough space on each page so that those plays with larger descriptions had room to sit while those with shorter ones don't look like empty pages.</p>
