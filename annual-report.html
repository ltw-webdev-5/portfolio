        <p class="push-2">This project was a practice in layouts for larger scale documents. The mock client was World Animal Protection and the assignemt was to design their annual report for 2016. It had to be in full colour with real images from their website.</p>

            <p class="push-1-4">Step one was determining an appropraite layout for the book. After reading through the material I began my process by creating some sketches of possible layout designs.</p>

          <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1 push-2">
            <p class="push-1-4">After deciding on the basic layout design of my report, my next step was to decide on fonts and colour. The only colour used in the World Animal Protect logo other than black is and orange colour. I decided to use this throughout the report as accent colours. Choosing a header font was also made simple by sticking with their current brand. Across their website they use Futura, so this is what I decided to use for the headers. The task now was to find a body copy font that would pair well with it. I compared all the elements of the type faces with possible serif font until I found a matching pair.</p>

          <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1 push-2">
            <p class="push-1-4">Once I had some layouts sketched and my InDesign file setup, I placed in the text and broke it into appropriate pages. Once this seperation was done I was able to begin applying layout to the pages based on my sketches. This stage allowed me to work out any kinks with my original sketches as I was able to see how the amount of copy there actaully was affected the design.</p>

          <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1 push-2">
            <p class="push-1-4">The final product is a clean layout with a good balance of white space, text, and images. The colour accents are subtle yet pop on the page to make one cohesive piece.</p>
