      <p class="intro-text milli max-length">I was very excited to be asked to work on this particular project, but also scared shitless. It was the first time someone had asked me to create illustrations for an entire website. Before I get into it, here’s a little background on what exactly is Project Big Life: </p>

      <p class="cs-text max-length milli">It is a website developed by doctors. They basically gather a bunch of data from Canadians to create online calculators about health. For example, the primary calculator will tell you your Life Expectancy, another your Heart Age. It’s a really cool concept and thousands of people have used it. Not too long ago, they decided to redesign the entire website since the last one was looking pretty dated. </p>

      <p class="cs-text max-length milli">In comes me. I’ve always loved illustration and dreamed about this kind of project and here it was. I had no idea how to start, or what I wanted it to look like. After a lot of frustration, I took a step back and tried to do it the right way: research styles I liked, understand who will be looking at these, how will they be used…  After defining these elements, I jumped into it. </p>

        <p class="cs-text max-length milli">I knew it would be very people oriented, so I would have to draw a lot of bodies. SCARY. I started by the easy part: determining what their faces would look like; they had to be approachable, and more specifically, looking at the user whenever possible. I explored different skin tones and styles, as well as angles and ended up with this. </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="gutter max-length milli no-space">I was pretty happy with it. Then I moved on to the bodies. I needed to determine how I wanted their arms to look, how much detail was the perfect amount and so on. When I finished one, I showed it to the team and they were all pretty pleased with the results!</p>
