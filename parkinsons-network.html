      <p class="base-sans light push-0">Sometimes really cool projects just fall through, and that’s okay. What do you do then? Make it anyways. That’s what happened with this particular project. I was really excited to work on a platform for Parkinson’s patients but it didn’t work out. I decided to make it to gain more insight of web and application design.</p>

      <p class="milli serif">This is in no way accurate or tested or anything. It was really to explore interactivity and designing things I’ve always wanted to do: dashboards, cool icons and apps. I did keep in mind what I thought would be useful for Parkinson’s patients, based on my limited research and knowledge.</p>

      <p class="milli push-2 serif">I created a false Network, and started by creating the website. I wanted the primary colour to be bright, because we are still dealing with a serious topic. After some research, I found out the international symbol for Parkinson’s is the red tulip, so naturally using a bright red made sense.</p>
