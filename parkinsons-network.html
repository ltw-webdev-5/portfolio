    <p class="milli push-2">Sometimes really cool projects just fall through, and that’s okay. What do you do then? Make it anyways. That’s what happened with this particular project. I was really excited to work on a platform for Parkinson’s patients but it didn’t work out. I decided to make it to gain more insight of web and application design.</p>
    <p class="milli push-2">This is in no way accurate or tested or anything. It was really to explore interactivity and designing things I’ve always wanted to do: dashboards, cool icons and apps. I did keep in mind what I thought would be useful for Parkinson’s patients, based on my limited research and knowledge.</p>
    <p class="milli push-2">I created a false Network, and started by creating the website. I wanted the primary colour to be bright, because we are still dealing with a serious topic. After some research, I found out the international symbol for Parkinson’s is the red tulip, so naturally using a bright red made sense. </p>

    <p class="milli push-2">Next was the portal itself. It was important to design for both patient and physician. I created a portal where patients can easily track their symptoms and complete assessments, that way when they visit their physician, the time can be spent discussing the important issues and not doing paperwork.</p>

    <p class="milli push-2">The companion app was also created to allow patients to track and complete assessments wherever they are. You aren’t always near a computer when a symptom occurs. So this was very important as well. </p>
