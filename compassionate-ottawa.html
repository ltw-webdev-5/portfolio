          sentence1="The clients initially came seeking fresh eyes to help them upgrade their website in order to make it more appealing to younger audiences. My team and I concluded that in order to bring a younger, more serious audience their way, they needed to expand upon their branding—especially their logo. The clients were very happy with the colours that were already being used to represent their brand, so I made sure to brand around the colours they had in place."
          sentence2="When working on the logo I really wanted to focus on the aspect of life—but more specifically, the cycle of life is what drove my ideas. This was because when thinking about the overall message of Compassionate Ottawa I wanted the logo to represent death, dying, and grief in a friendly way. Therefore, I chose to incorporate leaves into the logo, because leaves are in an endless cycle of renewal—they grow, change colours, fall from the trees, and then the cycle repeats. The same thing happens with people, except we grow from babies, to toddlers, to adults, to elders."

            sentence1="I worked with two teammates who rewrote the content for the new website and with the content they wrote, I made some website mock-ups to match the new brand. Their old website was overly text heavy, lacked images, and lacked overall personality. I wanted to breathe some personality into the new website with icons, and happier/more personal imagery in order to match the new friendlier and more inviting brand and tone. I also wanted to incorporate more white space so that when someone went to their site they were not overwhelmed or confused."
            sentence2="This project was really fun to work on and it allowed me the opportunity to make my first real logo and website design for a client. This project made me realize how much I really love branding!"
