    <h1 class="text-center grey-text giga">Hi! I'm Megan Smith.</h1>
    <p class="max-length">I got my start in graphic design doing photo manipulation pieces in Photoshop for fun. I did that for about a year and a half before coming into the program and I always thought that's all I was oging to do. After having come into the program I fell in love with lots more areas of design. I was never the best at drawing or animating but I've gotten so much practive over the 3 years.</p>
