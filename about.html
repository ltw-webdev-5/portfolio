    <h1 class="text-center grey-text mega max-length">Hi! I'm Megan Smith.</h1>
    <p class="max-about push-1-2 milli">I am passionate about graphic design and visual arts. I love illustration and building brands, but aside from design I have another love—music. I get a lot of my inspiration from music and I love that a persons music taste can really say who they are or how they feel without them even having to speak. </p>
    <p class="max-about push-0 milli">Music isn’t much different from graphic design or visual art. I believe that designs should be able to speak for themselves without any explanation. They should have their own voices, styles, and stories. Music and design are both subjective, but telling the story you want to tell and having people understand just by looking... that's always my goal!</p>
