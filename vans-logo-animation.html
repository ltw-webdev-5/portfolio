        <p class="">The assignment for this project was to create an animation video for an existing logo. I chose to create my based on the Vans logo because it is a brand I love and know well. The goal was to create a logo that fits with the grunge, skater vibe the brand owns.</p>

        <div class="push-2">
          <p class="push-1-4">I started this process by creating some rough sketches which describe my vision for the video. I did this is a storyboard style, roughing out various stages in the video to demonstrate the stages of the animation. After this process was complete my next step was to create a style frame for the video which included all the assets I would need.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="push-2">
          <p class="push-1-4">Once all the assets were created and I had a plan for my video it was time to start creating.</p>

        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="push-2">As the main aspect of the video would be done through rotoscoping, I had to find some reference videos which I could mash together into one smooth sequence. Once I had found what I needed I began the process of rotoscoping.</p>

          <img itemprop="image" class="img-flex" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/vans-logo-animation/shot-1.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <div>
          <p class="push-1-4">The last step was to add some effects to the rest of the video and a mask reveal to the paint strokes to give it a more dynamic look. The final result suites the brand and gives a very street/skater feel.</p>
