        <p class="">The assignment for this project was to create an animation video for an existing logo. I chose to create my based on the Vans logo because it is a brand I love and know well.</p>

          <img itemprop="image" class="img-flex" src="https://via.placeholder.com/1200x300" alt="">

            <h2 class="push-1-2" id="deco-line-section-header-short">Design Process</h2>
          </div>

          <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1">
            <p class="push-1-4">I started this process by creating some rough sketches which describe my vision for the video. I did this is a storyboard style, roughing out various stages in the video to demonstrate the stages of the animation. After this process was complete my next step was to create a style frame for the video which included all the assets I would need.</p>

          <div class="unit xs-1 s-1-2 m-1-2 l-1-2 push-2">
            <img itemprop="image" class="img-flex" src="https://via.placeholder.com/200" alt="">
          </div>
          <div class="unit xs-1 s-1-2 m-1-2 l-1-2 push-2">
            <img itemprop="image" class="img-flex" src="https://via.placeholder.com/200" alt="">
          </div>

          <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1">
            <p class="push-1-4">One all the assets were created and I had a plan for my video it was time to start creating. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="unit xs-1 s-1-2 m-1 l-1 push-2">
            <img itemprop="image" class="img-flex" src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x300" alt="">
          </div>

          <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1">
            <p class="push-1-4">To bring this design to the next level I decided to tun it into a moving poster rather than just a static poster. A moving poster would allow for more interest when used on screens and the web. I also wanted to bring the static poster to the next level and do a bit of a redesign of it. I chose a new dancer photo with a different pose. Rather than using a photograph again I decided to make the dancer more artistic and created a graphic illustration of the dancer instead. Choosing a new dance pose also required me to redesign the layout of the text.</p>

          <div class="unit xs-1 s-1-2 m-1 l-1 push-2">
            <div style="padding:64.63% 0 0 0;position:relative;">
              <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/297625784?autoplay=1&loop=1" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
          </div>
          <div class="unit xs-1 s-1-2 m-1 l-1">
            <p class="push-1-4">Once the new layout was created all that was left was to add movement to the words and the dancer. By placing all the text on different layers I was able to manipulate the text word by word and have them move with the dancer as he moves through his jump. This added even more depth and movement to the already dynamic poster design and brought it to the next level.</p>
