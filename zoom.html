          sentence1="Right off the bat this project was very tricky for me. I had a hard time thinking of how I could effectively improve the site. I wanted to do something that was more innovative than just changing up the colours and images, but still intriguing and eye catching for users. That’s how I came up with the idea of scrolling through a computer screen. I chose to have the website through the visual of a computer screen because I wanted it to be like the act of scrolling through an online app. I wanted the user to be placed into the visuals and actually be able to interact with, and control the main element that was on the homepage—the screen on the desk."
          sentence2="With this project I went through many rounds of sketching trying to figure out how I wanted the illustrations to look. After working on paper for a while with very little luck, I switched to the computer to see if I could think of any that way. I was able to produce some good ideas that I thought fit very well with not only what I was trying to go for, but also Zoom’s overall brand itself."
