### [Megan Smith's Portfolio](http://megansmithdesigns.ca/)

I am whole heartedly inspired by psychology, and how the brain works. But as a creative, I found myself struggling to find what I wanted to do in my future. I wanted to be able to incorporate both my love for psychology and fine arts, but I didn’t want to go into either of those fields. So, when I came across graphic design it strongly resonated with me, because I thought “hey, I could make something, and it could then be associated with a product or company”. Psychology and art working together at their finest, am I right?
