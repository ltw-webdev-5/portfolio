I’ve always been interested in art but, I am also whole heartedly inspired by psychology, and how the brain works. I found myself struggling to find what I wanted to do in my future because I wanted to be able to incorporate both my love for psychology and fine arts, but I didn’t want to go into either of those fields. So, when I came across graphic design it strongly resonated with me, because I thought “hey, I could make a something and it could then be associated with a product or company”. Psychology and art working together at their finest, am I right?
