          sentence1="The first step of this project was to paint out strokes on paper and then vectorize them in Illustrator. After making my brushes I wasn’t exactly sure what I wanted to paint. However, I knew that I wanted to do a project involving Kid Cudi at some point—and this was the perfect opportunity. "
          sentence2="I incorporated the colours of his most recent album Kids See Ghosts into the illustration to give it more personality, while also trying to bring attention to the album. Initially, the illustration was done well, but it was plain and lacked personality. That’s where the text comes in. I wanted to incorporate his name into the poster, and I tried a lot of different styles of text. I settled on making the text look kind of grungy and sketch-like to match the rest of the composition. This piece works as a simple poster, but it can also work on plenty of other things such as phone cases, shirts, etc."
