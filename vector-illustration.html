      <h2 class="kilo push-0">Goal</h2>
      <p class="milli grey-text">Make my own set of custom vector brushes in Illustrator and use them to create a digital painting of a person or original character.</p>
      <p class="milli grey-text">For my vector painting I chose to do Kid Cudi. I’m a big fan of Kid Cudi and his music so I had wanted to do a portrait of him for a while and this was the perfect opportunity for me to do so. The colours used in the illustration represent not only the bright and colourful aura of him and his music, but they're also some of the main colours that are used on his latest album Kids See Ghosts. </p>
      <p class="milli grey-text">The first step of this project was to paint out strokes on paper and then vectorize them in Illustrator.</p>
      <h2 class="kilo">Process</h2>
      <h2 class="kilo">Final</h2>
      <h2 class="kilo push-0">Challenges</h2>
      <p class="milli push-0 grey-text">I had to restart this illustration 2 times before the completed version. The first two times I didn’t get the right details in the anatomy of the face and it didn’t really look like Kid Cudi. I also submitted this project without any of the text, so it was really plain. Considering there was so much detail in the painting, I had to find a way to make the background match.</p>
