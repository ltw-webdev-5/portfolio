  {% pattern cards/card-image-left heading="The Product" text="When deciding what kind of company I wanted to create for this project, I looked at what was new in the market. Infusing THC into food had just become legalized in Canada which made it brand new to the market. This presented tons of new opportunities." image="/images/baking.jpg"%}

  {% pattern cards/card-image-right heading="The Brand" text="Since Canada has only recently legalized edibles, there aren’t any studies done for what kind of people buy edibles. Due to this, I designed the brand to apeal to the demographic for cannabis.
Research shows that more then half of cannabis consumers are between the ages of 21-39 and more then half are male. I also wanted this edibles company to have a theme. Taking the demographic into consideration, I decided to make the campany space themed and name it Space Cadet Edibles." image="/images/demographic-cannabis.jpg"%}

I realized the top part of the leaf was the same shape as the tip of a rocket. I immediately started sketching and coming up with different variations." image="/images/leaf-rocket.jpg"%}

In the first stage of logos (1), I found the smoke coming from the rocket to flat. In the second stage of the logo (2), I made the smoke more fluffy and cloud liked. Both version were presented to a group of designers to discuss which would be more effective and the second version was chosen." image="/images/space-cadet-logo-card.jpg"%}
