        <p class="push-2">For this project I wanted to do a piece of illustative work that wasn't just a flat poster style image. I decided to create a product design and I chose to do it for a snowboard. Rather than just doing a single design, however I decided to create the beginnings of a series of board designs.</p>

          <p class="push-1-4">The first step for this project was to come up with a design. This started with sketches. I created some sketches for a few different ideas, but I wasn't really feeling any of them. I continued to sketch until the idea of a wolf popped into my head. I pictured a howling wolf on the board and the idea took off from there. I created some more sketches for this new idea and then moved into some basic vector work to see if I could recreate my idea.</p>

        <div class="push-2">
          <p class="push-1-4">After beginning the illustration in Illustrator the design evolved again. The board took on a transitional design from one end to the other. It was a trasition from a more realistic style to a more graphic style. The wolf took on the graphic silhuette style and from him up throught the horizon the realism increased with each piece in the image. This would have to be the front of the board and I wanted the back to be linked to the front but much more simplified. I chose to use the back of the board to create a name for the design. This created a clean look that still connected to the main illustration.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="push-2">
          <p class="push-1-4">The next step for this project was to design the second board. I decided to use the same theme of transition from the first design on the second board. This would make the designs connect while still being different and allow them to not only be connected by viewers as a pair, but recongize them as my style of work. After completing another, but slightly shorter round of sketches I came up with another design. The scene would be similar to the first as it would have the transition from graphic to realistic and it would also be a horizon illustration. this time rather than doing another night scene I would do a sunrise. While wolves are associated with the full moon, deer are often associated with early morning, so it would be the feature of this piece. The set up would remain the same with the main image on the front of the board and the back reserved for the name of the design.</p>
