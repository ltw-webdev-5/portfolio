    <p class="project-intro giga">Project Big Life are algorithms that help predict your life expectancy, risk of disease, and diet quality.</p>
    <p class="project-intro push-0">I had the opportunity to develop PBL’s illustration style from scratch. But how do you deal with such a heavy subject matter? These calculators essentially inform you of when you are going to die, so it was very important that the information be presented in an approachable manner. We wanted to encourage  users to complete the assessments. So we I got to creating!</p>

      <p class="navy light">My first order of business was to establish a style. I wanted the look to be bubbly, fun and eye catching in a way distract people from the heaviness of these algorithms.</p>

    <p class="navy light">The PBL team was really loving where these illustrations were heading. They wanted to incorporate more of them in all aspects of the project. I learned that they often give talks about end of life care and used <i>profiles</i> as example patients. So why not draw some up?!</p>

    <p class="light navy push">I remember when I first found out about this project, and the first thing I thought was <i>Wow! I'm so happy I don't have to create all these illustrations, I could never do it</i>. It looked so daunting to me and nearly impossible.</p>
    <p class="light navy push">But then they asked me to do it. I got overwhelmed, but then just seperated the project into smaller tasks and didn't start with the big stuff. Yeah, I deleted and restarted and probably skipped a few steps, but I did it and it became my favourite project I've done.</p>
