      <p class="push-2 base-sans">Over the past few months, I have had the pleasure of working with the <a href="https://ottawamhealth.ca">Ottawa mHealth Lab</a> team creating various applications for healthcare. Our main project is CANImmunize, a digital vaccination record tool for Canadians.</p>

      <h4 class="push-1-2">Web Client</h4>
      <p class="milli push-2 serif">When I joined the team, the primary project was the web version of the already existant CANImmunize application. They were unhappy with the product at the time and asked me to come up with new designs. We landed on this one.</p>

      <h5 class="push-1-2">Icons</h5>
      <p class="milli serif">One of the first things I noticed when I started working on CANImmunize, was that all the icons were different. I later learned that they were all stock icons. This had to be changed.</p>
      <p class="milli serif">I desperately wanted to design new fresh icons with an estalished look, but with all the work that had to be done, it just wasn't in the books time wise. Later on as I was designing icons for another project, it became apparent that I really enjoyed making them, so I got the go ahead to create some for CANImmunize.</p>
      <p class="milli serif push-2">Originally, I was using at outlined style, but after some discussion with coworkers, we determined the material style was the way to go. Here's a look at the icons.</p>
