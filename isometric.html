      <h2 class="kilo push-0">Goal</h2>
      <p class="milli push grey-text">Create an isometric illustration that depicts a process.</p>
      <p class="milli push grey-text">This piece depicts one of my favourite bands—Twenty One Pilots—going through the cycle of music production. From writing music on the living room floor, producing music in the studio, to then performing on a stage. When I first started sketching, I wasn’t exactly sure how I would want things to look. I tried many different ways of doing the bases for each stage, and I also thought of connecting the platforms with staircases to show the journey that it takes to get to the concert stage of the process. </p>
      <h2 class="kilo">Stage Process</h2>
      <p class="milli push grey-text">I decided to go ahead with the floating bases because it best shows that it’s not easy to get from one step to another in the music industry.</p>
      <h2 class="kilo">Final Poster</h2>
      <p class="milli push grey-text">The illustration looks good, but I struggled with getting the platforms in the composition to look like they belonged together. It wasn’t until I came back to these illustrations that I decided I could make an advertisement video that promotes the tour. This advertisement allows fans to see the process of their favourite band making music one individual step at a time.</p>
      <h2 class="kilo">Final Video</h2>
      <h2 class="kilo">Challenges</h2>
      <p class="milli push grey-text">As stated above, one of my biggest challenges was getting the steps to look like they belonged together.</p>
      <p class="milli push grey-text italic">Disclaimer: The logo that is on the backdrop of the stage was not made by me; it is the official Twenty One Pilots Bandito tour logo.</p>
