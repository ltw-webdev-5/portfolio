I tried many different ways of doing the bases for each stage, and I also thought of connecting the platforms with staircases to show the journey that it takes to get to the concert stage of the process."
            sentence2="The illustration looks good, but I struggled with getting the platforms in the composition to look like they belonged together. It wasn’t until I came back to these illustrations that I decided I could make an animated UI video to show the process one step at a time. I decided to use these illustrations as a banner for a recording studio website mockup. The UI layout visually shows the user the steps of the process accompanied by a call to action that would get them to want to learn more about how to bring their music dreams to life."
